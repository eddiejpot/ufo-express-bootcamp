I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","post_create_date_time":"10/2/2016 22:00","sighting_date":"10/2/2019","sighting_time":"21:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"text":"I walked out onto my back deck, checking to make sure everything was inside before going to bed. As I walked out the door, a bright orange glowing object to my west immediately caught my attention. It was just hovering in place. Almost as if we were staring at each other for a moment. It was close enough I could see a sphere shaped object, with a very bright orange glow emerging from it. I heard no engine, no noise whatsoever ever. It was as quiet as the night sky can be. My husband and I live in a small rule town with no traffic, and very secluded. I was so caught off guard and could not believe what I was looking at. It was nothing I had ever seen before. I stared at this for probably 15-20 seconds. As I continued to stare I called out my husbandâ€™s name at least 3-4 times, getting louder each time. Once I started to scream for my husband, this object starts to move north in a very slow speed.","post_create_date_time":"10/2/2016 22:00","sighting_date":"10/2/2016","sighting_time":"23:00","city":"Monroe City","state":"MO","shape":"Sphere","duration":"5 minutes","summary":"Sphere clump of bright gold and white lights. silent and below the fog and fast."},{"city":"Oak Island","state":"NC","shape":"Circle","sighting_date":"10/2/2020","sighting_time":"21:00","duration":"200 minutes","summary":"Bright lights appeared off the coast, multiplied, disappeared, and a single light reappeared and vanished again.","text":"Bright lights appeared off the coast, multiplied, disappeared, and a single light reappeared and vanished again.We were driving down Beach Dr near 46th St SE when a set of white-red lights appeared off the coast, roughly 10,000 ft and several miles from the shoreline.
