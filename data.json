Was looking out my window and saw a orange colored, non blinking light floating across the night sky. Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.","post_create_date_time":"10/2/2019 22:00"},{"text":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin I witnessed 10 or 11 spherical glowing objects in formation swarming and hovering near the top of Ring Mtn. -Corte Madera.  I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","post_create_date_time":"10/2/2016 22:00","sighting_date":"10/2/2019","sighting_time":"21:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"text":"They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
